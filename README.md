Hey guys, this is my own error page, specially made for pranks. As you can see, there is the file with the code to inspect, and if you want you are free to make your own version, as long as you follow the policies we all know.
As you can edit it, you can also use it for your own use, such as making a prank on your friends, family, etc...
